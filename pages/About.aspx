   <p> I created this website because I wanted to learn creating websites. Thus, I see its value in rather being a good exercise than in presenting the content. While admitting it I also would like to add that I selected the topic because of the data, results of almost 1000 EDS analyses I’ve done, owned and could use for learning server-side development, and they were made fully available, as accurately as possible, so I hope they can be interesting or useful also for somebody else. </p>

   <p> The website presents the results of my master dissertation together with all the data I gathered during its preparation. I have made available an almost unchanged version of the original paper. As such, it inherits all the imperfections of an assessment work (please see Feedback section for more details). </p>

   <p><small>The dissertation was submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of MSc in the Technology and Analysis of Archaeological Materials of University College London in 2012.</small></p>

   <h4>Abstract</h4>
   <p> Archaeological excavations in the area of the currently operating copper and gold mine in the Sepon region in Laos, revealed a rich archaeological assemblage related to the Iron Age copper production. In the presented paper several categories of finds: crucible fragments, slag pieces, mineral samples and a copper ingot discovered during the first fieldworks season in 2008 at Peun Baolo and Thong Na Nguak, two sites situated within the mining district, were examined in order to explain technological aspects of the process they represent. In total 35 finds were sampled and analysed with the use of microscopic methods (optical and electron microscopy) supported by chemical analyses conducted with the ED system attached to the SEM.</p>
   <p> The investigation confirmed the existence of the developed copper production in the second half of the first millennium BC in the Sepon region. The manufacturing process comprised the whole sequence of operations from smelting of copper ore to the bronze foundry. According to the initial interpretation presented here, copper smelting was based on the furnace technology while refining of impure copper and its alloying was conducted in open crucibles.</p>
