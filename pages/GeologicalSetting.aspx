    <p>The Sepon region is situated along the Truong Son Fold Belt, a NW-trending track of folded Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks with major granite intrusion which occupies north-centre of Laos and extends eastward into central Vietnam (Workman, 1997, p. 496). The style of mineralisation in the Sepon district and its mining potential was recognised in 1990 when copper and gold lodes covering a variety of primary and secondary types were first documented (Manini & Albert, online). <p>
	<p>Three main hypogene mineralisation styles were recognised comprising distal sedimentary rock hosted gold, proximal skarn (Cu, Au) and central porphyry (Cu-Mo). There are epigenetic in their origin involving magmatic and minor metamorphic fluids and occur along the faults and/or veins cutting all of the Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks (Cromie, 2010; Workman, 1997). Common sulphide minerals in the Sepon mineral district are pyrite, arsenic-rich pyrite, chalcopyrite, minor sphalerite, galena, bornite and stibnite (Workman, 1997). </p>
	<p>Gold mineralisation occurring as fine dissemination is predominantly hosted by highly altered calcareous shale (Manini & Albert, online). </p>
	<p>The supergene copper enrichment derived from the weathering of a replacement style massive sulphide deposits developed in carbonate rocks was discovered at three deposits, namely Khonong, Thengkham North and Thengkham South (Workman, 1997). Among them the Khonong lode is the biggest and richest one. Copper minerals present are mainly chalcocite, with minor covellite, malachite, azurite and same native copper (Baxter, Dreisinger, & Pratt, online). </p>
	<p>Above the enrichment zone there is a well-developed lateritic profile which forms a leached cup to the supergene copper mineralisation and comprises gossan, ironstone boulders and red ferruginous clay soils. It is generally assumed that copper is leached away from the laterite (Baxter et al., online). </p>
