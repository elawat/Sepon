    <p>Two analytical techniques were employed in the analysis of the artefacts: scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) and optical microscopy (reflected light microscopy and thin section petrography). All analyses were carried out in the Wolfson Archaeological Science Laboratory at the UCL Institute of Archaeology. For full record on the equipment used and working conditions, see Appendix 1.</p>
